## Additional info for Project Consumers & Contributors

## For Consumers

The OpenTDF service is the main entry point for the OpenTDF platform. [See service documentation](./service/README.md)
for more information.

### Quick Start

Consumers of the OpenTDF platform: [Running the Platform Locally](./docs/Consuming.md).

### Multi-Strategy Entity Resolution Service

The OpenTDF platform supports a powerful multi-strategy Entity Resolution Service (ERS) that can integrate with multiple identity providers and data sources simultaneously.

#### Quick Start with Multi-Strategy ERS (Preview)

> **⚠️ Preview Feature**: Multi-Strategy ERS is in preview (V2 only). APIs may change.

To run OpenTDF with comprehensive entity resolution using SQL and LDAP providers:

```sh
# Start core infrastructure + ERS test services
docker compose --profile ers-test up

# Use the multi-strategy configuration
go run ./service start --config opentdf-ers-test.yaml
```

This enables entity resolution from:
- **JWT Claims** - Direct token claim extraction
- **PostgreSQL** - SQL database queries for organizational data
- **LDAP/Active Directory** - Directory service integration

#### ERS Provider Testing

Test the multi-strategy ERS functionality:

```sh
# Run integration tests (Docker services provide the backends automatically)
go test ./service/entityresolution/integration -run TestMultiStrategy -v
```

#### Configuration Options

- **`opentdf-ers-test.yaml`** - Complete OpenTDF platform with multi-strategy ERS
- **`ERS_TESTING.md`** - Comprehensive documentation and examples

The multi-strategy ERS (preview) provides enterprise-grade identity resolution with failover, multiple provider support, and flexible mapping strategies.

## For Contributors

This section is focused on the development of the OpenTDF platform.

### Libraries

Libraries `./lib` are shared libraries that are used across the OpenTDF platform. These libraries are used to provide
common functionality between the various sub-modules of the platform monorepo. Specifically, these libraries are shared
between the services and the SDKs.

### Services

Services `./services` are the core building blocks of the OpenTDF platform. Generally, each service is one or more gRPC services that
are scoped to a namespace. The essence of the service is that it takes a modular binary architecture approach enabling
multiple deployment models.

### SDKs

SDKs `./sdk` are the contracts which the platform uses to ensure that developers and services can interact with the
platform. The SDKs contain a native Go SDK and generated Go service SDKs. A full list of SDKs can be found at
[github.com/opentdf](https://github.com/opentdf).

### How To Add a New Go Module

Within this repo, to define a new, distinct [go module](https://go.dev/ref/mod),
for example to provide shared functionality between several existing modules,
or to define new and unique functionality
follow these steps.
For this example, we will call our new module `lib/foo`.

```sh
mkdir -p lib/foo
cd lib/foo
go mod init github.com/opentdf/platform/lib/foo
go work use .
```

In this folder, create your go code as usual.

#### Add a README.md and a LICENSE File

A README is recommended to assist with orientation to use of your package.
Remember, this will be published to <https://pkg.go.dev/> as part of the module documentation.

Make sure to add a LICENSE file to your module to support automated license checks.
Feel free to copy the existing (BSD-clear) LICENSE file for most new modules.

#### Updating the Makefile

1. Add your module to the `MODS` variable:

   ```Makefile
   MODS=protocol/go sdk . examples lib/foo
   ```

2. _If required_ If your project does not generate a built artifact,
   add a phony binary target to the `.PHONY` declaration.

   ```Makefile
   .PHONY: ...existing phony targets... lib/foo/foo
   ```

3. Add your build target to the `build` phony target.

   ```Makefile
   build: ...existing targets... lib/foo/foo
   ```

4. Add your build target and rule

   ```Makefile
   lib/foo/foo: $(shell find lib/foo)
    (cd lib/foo && go build ./...)
   ```

#### Updating the Docker Images

Add any required `COPY` directives to `./Dockerfile`:

```Dockerfile
COPY lib/foo/ lib/foo/
```

#### Updating the Workflow Files

1. Add your new `go.mod` directory to the `.github/workflows/checks.yaml`'s `go` job's `strategy.matrix.directory` line.
2. Add the module to the `license` job in the `checks` workflow as well, especially if you declare _any_ dependencies.
3. Do the same for any other workflows that should be running on your folder, such as `vuln-check` and `lint`.

## Generating API Documentation

To generate all protobuf, gRPC, and OpenAPI documentation (including OpenAPI v2 and v3.1 for ConnectRPC), run:

```fish
make proto-generate
```

This will output documentation to `docs/openapi` and `docs/grpc`.

### Required Tools

Install the following tools if you haven't already:

```fish
# Install buf
brew install bufbuild/buf/buf
# or
go install github.com/bufbuild/buf/cmd/buf@latest

# Install protoc-gen-doc
go install github.com/pseudomuto/protoc-gen-doc/cmd/protoc-gen-doc@v1.5.1

# Install protoc-gen-connect-openapi
go install github.com/sudorandom/protoc-gen-connect-openapi@latest
```

Make sure your Go bin directory (usually `$HOME/go/bin`) is in your `PATH`.

## Terms and Concepts

Common terms used in the OpenTDF platform.

**Service** is the core service of the OpenTDF platform as well as the sub-services that make up the platform. The main
service follows a modular binary architecture, while the sub-services are gRPC services with HTTP gateways.

**Policy** is the set of rules that govern access to the platform.

**OIDC** is the OpenID Connect protocol used solely for authentication within the OpenTDF platform.

- **IdP** - Identity Provider. This is the service that authenticates the user.
- **Keycloak** is the turn-key OIDC provider used within the platform for proof-of-value, but should be replaced with a
  production-grade OIDC provider or deployment.

**Attribute Based Access Control** (ABAC) is the policy-based access control model used within the OpenTDF platform.

- PEP - A Policy Enforcement Point. This is a service that enforces access control policies.
- PDP - A Policy Decision Point. This is a service that makes access control decisions.

**Entities** are the main actors within the OpenTDF platform. These include people and systems.

- Person Entity (PE) - A person entity is a person that is interacting with the platform.
- Non Person Entity (NPE) - A non-person entity is a service or system that is interacting with the platform.

**SDKs** are the contracts which the platform uses to ensure that developers and services can interact with the platform.

- SDK - The native Go OpenTDF SDK (other languages are outside the platform repo).
  - A full list of SDKs can be found at [github.com/opentdf](https://github.com/opentdf).
- Service SDK - The SDK generated from the service proto definitions.
  - The proto definitions are maintained by each service.
