## Development

### Prerequisites

#### Required

- Go (_see go.mod for specific version_)
- Container runtime
  - [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
  - [Podman](https://podman.io/docs/installation)
- Compose - used to manage multi-container applications
  - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
  - [Podman Compose](https://github.com/containers/podman-compose)

#### Optional

- [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air) is used for hot-reload development
  - install with `go install github.com/cosmtrek/air`
- [Buf](https://buf.build/docs/ecosystem/cli-overview) is used for managing protobuf files
  - install with `go install github.com/bufbuild/buf/cmd/buf`
- [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/) is used for ensuring good coding practices
  - install with `brew install golangci-lint`
- [grpcurl](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl) is used for testing gRPC services
  - install with `go install github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/cmd/grpcurl`

On macOS, these can be installed with [brew](https://docs.brew.sh/Installation)

```sh
brew install buf golangci-lint goose grpcurl openssl

```

### Run

> [!NOTE]
> Migrations are handled automatically by the server. This can be disabled via the config file, as
> needed. They can also be run manually using the `migrate` command
> (`make go.work`;`go run github.com/opentdf/platform/service migrate up`).

1. `docker-compose up`
2. Create an OpenTDF config file: `opentdf.yaml`
   1. The `opentdf-example.yaml` file is a good starting point, but you may need to modify it to match your environment.
   2. The `opentdf-example-no-kas.yaml` file configures the platform to run insecurely without KAS and without endpoint auth.
3. Provision keycloak: `go run github.com/opentdf/platform/service provision keycloak`
4. Configure KAS keys: `.github/scripts/init-temp-keys.sh`
5. Run the server: `go run github.com/opentdf/platform/service start`
   1. _Alt_ use the hot-reload development environment `air`
6. The server is now running on `localhost:8080` (or the port specified in the config file)

Note: support was added to provision a set of fixture data into the database.
Run `go run github.com/opentdf/platform/service provision fixtures -h` for more information.

### Generation

Our native gRPC service functions are generated from `proto` definitions using [Buf](https://buf.build/docs/introduction).

The `Makefile` provides command scripts to invoke `Buf` with the `buf.gen.yaml` config, including OpenAPI docs, grpc docs, and the
generated code.

For convenience, the `make pre-build` script checks if you have the necessary dependencies for `proto -> gRPC` generation.

## Services

### Key Access Service (KAS)

A KAS controls access to TDF protected content.

#### Configuration

To enable KAS, you must have stable asymmetric keypairs configured.
[The temp keys init script](.github/scripts/init-temp-keys.sh) will generate two development keys.

### Policy

The policy service is responsible for managing policy configurations. It provides a gRPC API for
creating, updating, and deleting policy configurations. [Docs](https://github.com/opentdf/platform/tree/main/docs)
