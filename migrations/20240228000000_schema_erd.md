title: Database Schema Mermaid Diagram
nodes: |
  This schema reflects the addition of SubjectConditions, which map external fields and values, like those
  provided in the context received about a user from an Identity Provider (idP) to an Attribute Value
  by way of a SubjectMapping. An Attribute Value will relate to one or more SubjectMappings with an
  'AND' relationship, and a SubjectMapping will have one or more SubjectConditions with an 'AND' relationship. If an 'OR' boolean relationship is needed, the policy administrator is recommended to utilize
  the 'ANY_OF' Attribute Definition rule and multiple Attribute Values with their own individual
  SubjectMappings.

  Following this schema, a SubjectCondition for a company "division" of "engineering" or "product" could
  be reused across multiple SubjectMappings. On its own, that SubjectCondition would contextualize an
  Attribute Value for "R & D". However, in a SubjectMapping combining it with a second
  SubjectCondition containing the external_field_name "title" and the external_field_values "executive",
  they would contextualize the mapped Attribute Value as essentially "R & D Executives".

  If the intended ABAC behavior was instead "R&D" _OR_ "Executives", the implementation would be an Attribute
  Definition with the rule 'ANY_OF' containing two separate Attribute Values, where each had a distinct
  SubjectMapping to the independent SubjectConditions. 

  Note: a name is optionally provided as a column on SubjectConditions (and constrained to be unique
  when provided) so that SubjectConditions can be more easily reused across varying SubjectMappings
  while allowing a policy administrator to query them by a slug instead of only a uuid.
