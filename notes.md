- service
    - provides `RegisterFunc` within result of `NewRegistration`
    - consumes `map[string]any` config as set on `srp.Config` in opentdf
        - maybe: `LoadConfigEnv[namespace]()(config[T], error)` ?
    - consumes `map[string]any` config as fetched from config service in DSP
    - provides `OnUpdateConfig` hook to reload when config changes
    - 

- opentdf server
    - providers registration params (including config yaml `.services[namespace]`)
    - calls svc.Start for each service
    - has to call hook to call config service in DSP
    - associates open config update channel to config service under service namespace

- config service
    - configuration of our PEPs and services with protos managed within the DSP repo
    - protos still make sense because:
        - versioned and enforced structure
        - testing of breaking changes
        - validation of RPCs
        - generated UI for admin-ui
