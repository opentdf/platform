# otdfctl: cli to manage OpenTDF Platform

This command line interface is used to manage OpenTDF Platform.

The main goals are to:

- simplify setup
- facilitate migration
- aid in configuration management

## TODO list

- [ ] Add support for json input as piped input
- [ ] Add help level handler for each command
- [ ] Add support for `--verbose` persistent flag
- [ ] Helper functions to support common tasks like pretty printing and json output

## Usage

The CLI is configured via profiles. Use `otdfctl profile create <name> <endpoint>` (and optionally `--set-default`) to define how the CLI should connect to your platform instance.

Load up the platform (see its [README](https://github.com/opentdf/platform?tab=readme-ov-file#run) for instructions).

## Development

### CLI

The CLI is built using [cobra](https://cobra.dev/).

The primary function is to support CRUD operations using commands as arguments and flags as the values.

The output format (currently `styled` or `json`) is stored with each profile (via `otdfctl profile create --output-format <styled|json>` or `otdfctl profile set-output-format <profile> <styled|json>`) and can still be overridden per command with the `--json` flag.

#### To add a command

1. Capture the flag value and validate the values
   1. Alt support JSON input as piped input
2. Run the handler which is located in `pkg/handlers` and pass the values as arguments
3. Handle any errors and return the result in a lite TUI format

### TUI

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a work in progress please avoid touching until framework is defined

The TUI will be used to create an interactive experience for the user.

## Documentation

Documentation drives the CLI in this project. This can be found in `/docs/man` and is used in the
CLI via the `man.Docs.GetDoc()` function.

## Testing

The CLI is equipped with a test mode that can be enabled by building the CLI with `config.TestMode = true`.
For convenience, the CLI can be built with `make build-test`.

**Test Mode features**:

- Use the in-memory keyring provider for user profiles
- Enable provisioning profiles for testing via `OTDFCTL_TEST_PROFILE` environment variable

### BATS

> [!NOTE]
> Bat Automated Test System (bats) is a TAP-compliant testing framework for Bash. It provides a simple way to verify that the UNIX programs you write behave as expected.

BATS is used to test the CLI from an end-to-end perspective. To run the tests you will need to ensure the following
prerequisites are met:

- bats is installed on your system
  - Follow bats-core advice [here](https://github.com/bats-core/homebrew-bats-core?tab=readme-ov-file#homebrew-bats-core)
- The platform is running and provisioned with basic keycloak clients/users
  - See the [platform README](https://github.com/opentdf/platform) for instructions

To run the tests you can either run `make test-bats` or execute specific test suites with `bats e2e/<test>.bats`.

#### Terminal Size

Some tests for output rendered in the terminal will vary in behavior depending on terminal size.

Terminal size when testing:

1. set to standard defaults if running `make test-bats`
2. can be set manually by mouse in terminal where tests are triggered
3. can be set by argument `./e2e/resize_terminal.sh < rows height > < columns width >`
4. can be set by environment variable, i.e. `export TEST_TERMINAL_WIDTH="200"` (200 is columns width)

#### TestRail Integration (Optional)

This project supports optional integration with TestRail for uploading BATS test results.

##### 1. Prerequisites

- TestRail account with API access enabled
- `jq`, `curl` installed

##### 2. Setup

1. Copy and configure TestRail connection: 
`cp testrail.config.example.json testrail.config.json`

  Edit `testrail.config.json` with:
  - `url`: Your TestRail instance URL
  - `projectId`: Your TestRail project ID 
  - `tapFile`: Path to BATS TAP results file 

2. Copy and configure test mapping:
  `cp testname-to-testrail-id.example.json testname-to-testrail-id.json`

Fill in the mapping between test names (exactly as they appear in TAP output) and your TestRail case IDs.
Can be flat JSON:
```json
{
  "test_name_1": "C12345",
  "test_name_2": "C67890"
}
```
Or nested for better organization:
```json
{
  "group_1": {
    "test_name_1": "C12345",
    "test_name_2": "C67890"
  },
  "group_2": {
    "test_name_3": "C54321"
  }
}
```

3. Set TestRail credentials via environment variables
```bash
   export TESTRAIL_USER=you@example.com
   export TESTRAIL_PASS=your_api_key
```

##### 3. Run Tests and Upload Results

1. Run BATS with TAP report output (e2e folder): `bats --tap bats-tests/ > e2e/bats-results.tap`
Alternatively, get the TAP test report from the CI pipeline artifacts.
2. Upload results to TestRail:
`TESTRAIL_CLI_RUN_NAME=*optional-testrail-run-name* ./testrail-integration/upload-bats-test-results-to-testrail.sh`
