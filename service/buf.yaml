  # Audit logger tests use a test.proto file that should not be included in normal proto gen,
  # so we exclude it here.  If the test.proto file ever needs to be modified, this
  # block will need to be commented out before running `make proto-generate`. The generated 
  # go file added in the protocol/go directory will need to be manually moved to the 
  # ./logger/audit directory, and any generated files in the /docs directory for the test proto
  # should be deleted. This process should be much simpler whenever we move to buf gen v2.
