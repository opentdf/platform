# Policy Service Architecture Decisions
  
> [!NOTE]
> Until [September 2024](./0000-current-state.md), most architectural decisions within `policy` have been documented within the `.md` files associated with relevant [database migrations](../db/migrations/) and Github issues. However, it has become clear that not every migration requires a record of a decision, and not every record of a decision requires a migration. We will decouple them from now on and associate them within markdown links as needed.

This folder contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Policy Service.  It not only maintains the historical record, but is also intended to provide a reference for future developers who may need to understand the reasoning behind the decisions in order to contribute effectively.

## Contributing

To add a new ADR, copy the latest version and then increment the number in the filename and make your updates.  For example, if the latest ADR is `0003-some-decision.md`, then the next ADR should be `0004-another-decision.md`.
