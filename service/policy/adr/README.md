# Policy Service Architecture Decisions

This folder contains the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Policy Service.  It not only maintains the historical record, but is also intended to provide a reference for future developers who may need to understand the reasoning behind the decisions in order to contribute effectively.

## Contributing

To add a new ADR, copy the latest version and then increment the number in the filename and make your updates.  For example, if the latest ADR is `0003-some-decision.md`, then the next ADR should be `0004-another-decision.md`.
